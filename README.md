Hash Tables

Hashing is one of the most important data structures.
Hashing has many applications where operations are limited to find, insert, and delete.
Dynamic hash tables have good amortized complexity.
Collision: when two keys map to the same location in the hash table.  
Two ways to resolve collisions:
1.Separate Chaining
2.Open Addressing (linear probing, quadratic probing, double hashing)
